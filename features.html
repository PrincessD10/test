    <h1>What is Travis CI Used For?</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2><p>Travis CI is primarily used for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) in software development</p></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automating Builds: Travis CI automatically builds projects whenever changes are pushed to a repository. This helps developers ensure that their code integrates smoothly and that new changes do not break existing functionality.
.</li>
        <li>Running Tests: After building the code, Travis CI runs test suites to verify that the application behaves as expected. This includes unit tests, integration tests and functional tests. You can configure Travis CI to run tests in different environments or with various configurations, ensuring broader compatibility.</li>
        <li>Deployment Automation: Travis CI can automatically deploy applications to different environments (e.g., production, staging) after successful builds and tests. This streamlines the release process. It also supports various deployment targets, including cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku and static site hosting like GitHub Pages.</li>
        <li>Notifications and Reporting: Travis CI provides real-time feedback on build status (success or failure) directly in the GitHub repository. This helps teams quickly identify and address issues. You can configure notifications to alert team members about build results, enhancing communication and collaboration.
</li>
        <li>Environment Management: Travis CI allows you to define specific programming languages, versions and dependencies in the .travis.yml configuration file, ensuring consistent build environments and making it versatile for various projects.
</li>
        <li>Code Quality Assurance: Travis CI can run code quality checks to catch potential issues before code is merged. This helps to maintain high standards within the codebase..</li>
